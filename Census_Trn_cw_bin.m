%CENSUS_TRN_CW_BIN Find the Binary Census Transform from a 2D-Array
% C = CENSUS_TRN_CW_BIN(I,BlockSize) takes a 2D array and performs local
% Census transform, each Block is saved as a logical binary vector across
% a 3rd dimension from C, the census transform is performed clockwise direction
% for each Block and only horizontal, vertical an diagonals pixels related
% to the center are taken into consideration to reduce memory usage
